### Team Members:

### Introduction/Description: 
Our team talked about different datasets and different approaches we wanted to take for this project and we all decided to focus on safety and helping other people new and local to the NYC area to log in and alert other people about safety issues in different parts of the city. 

This will serve as a forum where all users can log in and log in different concerns and happenings within different locations in New York City. The main goal of this project is to be informative and spread awareness about different spots in the city and help the community stay alert with user friendly UI. 

Our site also aims to show the frequency of the crimes in the area for different areas based on user input. This will allow for more accurate results and general areas to look out for when users are planning out their routes for their journeys. 
### How to Run:
